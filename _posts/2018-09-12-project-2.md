For this project, you will extend your [previous project]({% post_url 2018-08-27-project-1 %}) to support exact search and partial search. In addition to meeting the previous project requirements, your code must be able to parse and stem a query file, generate a sorted list of search results from the inverted index, and support writing those results to a JSON file.
