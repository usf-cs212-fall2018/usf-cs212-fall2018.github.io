For this project, you will extend your [previous project]({% post_url 2018-10-08-project-3 %}) to create a fully functional search engine. This project is split into two main components: (1) a [multithreaded web crawler]({% post_url 2018-11-04-project-4a-web-crawler %}) using a work queue to build the index from a seed URL, and (2) a [search engine web interface]({% post_url 2018-11-04-project-4b-search-engine %}) using [embedded Jetty](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/) and servlets to search that index.

This is the **last project** for this course. There will be no design grade for this project, only a functionality grade. However, you may earn up to a 120% on this project by completing additional functionality. The grade breakdown and eligibility requirements are as follows:

The search engine core and extra functionality will be graded in your final code review appointment during finals week. See the <a href="{% post_url 2018-11-04-project-4a-web-crawler %}">web crawler</a> and <a href="{% post_url 2018-11-04-project-4b-search-engine %}">search engine</a> writeups for more functionality details.

<article class="message is-warning">
  <div class="message-body"><i class="far fa-exclamation-triangle"></i>&nbsp;Regardless of what you implemented, you will NOT earn points for the search engine core functionality if you are not passing all of the web crawler tests, and will NOT earn points for extra functionality if you have not fully implemented the core functionality!</div>
</article>

<article class="message is-warning">
  <div class="message-body"><i class="far fa-exclamation-triangle"></i>&nbsp;You are still expected to deliver professional-quality code for your final code review appointment. This includes formatting, Javadoc comments, proper exception and resource handling, and proper generalization and encapsulation. Failing to do so may result in a <strong>point deduction</strong> to your final project 4 grade.</div>
