    <p>This syllabus is similar to a contract between students and the instructor, and as such it is quite long (with many sections required by the university). A few key points from this syllabus are highlighted here:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Use <a href="{{ site.data.course.piazza }}">Piazza</a> for all course communication. (See: <a href="#{{ "Email Policy" | slugify }}">Email Policy</a>)

      <li>You should be stuck for an hour on a problem before seeking help, but you should definitely seek help if you have been stuck for an hour. (See: <a href="#{{ "Getting Help" | slugify }}">Getting Help</a>)

      <li>Do not cheat. This includes working too closely with your classmates or the CS tutors.
      (See: <a href="#{{ "Cheating Policy" | slugify }}">Cheating Policy</a>)

      <li>You must pass at least one exam to avoid an automatic F in this class.
      (See: <a href="#{{ "Pass Requirements" | slugify }}">Pass Requirements</a>)

      <li>You must make enough progress on projects to avoid an automatic F in this class.
      (See: <a href="#{{ "Pass Requirements" | slugify }}">Pass Requirements</a>)

      <li>Treat this class like a part-time job and plan to spend 10 to 20 hours coding per week outside of class.
      (See: <a href="#{{ "Credit Hour Policy" | slugify }}">Credit Hour Policy</a>)
    </ul>

    <p>Students are still required to read through the entire syllabus below.</p>

{% include section.html level="h2" name="Course Requirements" %}

<p>This section covers how the learning outcomes for this course will be assessed. This course will be a hybrid flipped classroom, with an emphasis on mastery learning. The majority of the grade will be derived from projects and exams. See the following subsections for details.</p>

{% include section.html level="h3" name="Pass Requirements" %}

<p>To ensure students are meeting the <a href="#{{ "Learning Outcomes" | slugify }}">learning outcomes</a> for this course, students <strong>must</strong> meet the following minimum requirements to receive a non-failing grade (D- or higher) in this course:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p><strong>Exam Pass Requirement:</strong> Students must receive a C letter grade or higher on at least one exam (including retakes).</p></li>

  <li><p><strong>Project Pass Requirement 1:</strong> Students must pass the functionality requirements for a minimum of 2 projects and the design requirements for at least 1 project by the <a href="#{{ "Important Dates" | slugify }}">project cutoff</a> deadline.</p></li>

  <li><p><strong>Project Pass Requirement 2:</strong> Students must pass the functionality requirements for a minimum of 3 projects and the design requirements for at least 2 projects by the end of the semester.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Failure to meet 1 or more of the following requirements will result in an <strong>automatic F letter grade</strong> for this course, regardless of what your current letter grade is in Canvas.</p>

<p>If students are concerned about not meeting one or more of these requirements by the withdraw deadline, they are encouraged to withdraw from the class to avoid the F letter grade on their transcripts. Note, however, that a W (withdraw) counts as an attempt and CS majors and minors have restrictions on how many times they may attempt CS courses.</p>

Each project must pass several functionality tests and then undergo a rigorous code review checking for specific criteria, such as proper encapsulation and generalization, efficiency, and maintainability.</p>

<p>We use a <strong>mastery learning</strong> approach with projects: students must perfect both the functionality and design of the current project before moving on to the next project. The final project grade will depend on when and how many projects are completed.</p>

<p>Each project grade is split into two components: functionality (evaluated with project checkpoints) and design (evaluated with code reviews). The project checkpoint must be passed before the code review may be passed, students must pass code review for each project sequentially, and may only have one review appointment per week.</p>

{% include section.html level="h2" name="Course Policies" %}

<p>This section includes miscellaneous policies specific to this course, including email, attendance, credit hours, cheating, and more. These policies are <em>in addition</em> to the standard USF policies included later.</p>

{% include section.html level="h3" name="Email Policy" %}

<p>All course-related communication will be handled using <a href="{{ site.data.course.piazza }}">Piazza</a>&mdash;a FERPA-compliant Q&amp;A platform that supports public, anonymous, and private posts. When making posts on Piazza, please keep the following in mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Make a <strong>public post</strong> when appropriate. This lets us answer questions once for all students. You can <strong>post anonymously</strong> if you are uncomfortable with attaching your name to a post or a response. When posting anonymously, your classmates will not be able to see your identity, but instructors will still be able to see your name (necessary to give you credit for participation and ensure everyone is following the code of conduct).</p>

    <p><article class="message is-warning">
      <div class="message-body">
        <i class="fas fa-eye-slash"></i>&nbsp;If you make a private post that should be public, you will be asked to create a new public anonymous post before receiving an answer.
      </div>
    </article></p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Do not post code on Piazza. If you have a question regarding your specific code, please commit and push your code to your GitHub repository and post a link. That ensures only those with access to your repository (instructor and teacher assistants) will see your code.</p>

    <p><article class="message is-info">
      <div class="message-body">
        <i class="fas fa-code"></i>&nbsp;Small code snippets (under 5 lines) are okay as long as they are not revealing a homework, quiz, or project solution. For example, it is okay to post a small snippet from lecture and ask for clarification. It is not okay to publicly post the exact 1 line regular expression code needed to answer a quiz question.
      </div>
    </article></p>

  </li>

  <li><p>Make posts regarding grades or specific solutions <strong>private</strong> to the instructor and teacher assistants. When making private posts, they should always be marked as visible by both the instructor and teacher assistants so there is no confusion.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Too shy to ask or answer questions in class? No problem! Posting a public question or responding to a question on Piazza counts towards class participation.</p>

<article class="message is-danger">
  <div class="message-body">
    <i class="fas fa-envelope"></i>&nbsp;Any emails sent directly to the instructor or teacher assistants will redirected to Piazza before being answered.
  </div>
</article>

{% include section.html level="h3" name="Announcements Policy" %}

<p>All announcements will be posted on <a href="{{ site.data.course.piazza }}">Piazza</a>. All students are expected to enroll in Piazza and monitor the announcements in a timely manner. This includes any changes to the lecture, lab, office hour, or deadline schedule.</p>

{% include section.html level="h3" name="Attendance Policy" %}

<p>Students are expected to be on-time to all classes to minimize disruption. Attendance is mandatory for all exams, quizzes, guest speakers, and in-class exercises. Exam dates will be posted on the course schedule.</p>

<p>Attendance is mandatory for all one-on-one code review appointments. Students must be on-time to these appointments. If a student arrives more than 5 minutes late, the appointment will be canceled. Students risk a grade penalty for repeated canceled or missed appointments.</p>

{% include section.html level="h3" name="Credit Hour Policy" %}

<p>All courses at the University of San Francisco must comply with the <a href="https://myusf.usfca.edu/sites/default/files/usf_credit_hour_policy_0.pdf">Credit Hour Policy</a>, which states:

<blockquote>
<i class="fas fa-quote-left fa-sm"></i> One unit of credit in lecture, seminar, and discussion work should approximate one hour of direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out-of-class student work per week through one 15-week semester. <i class="fas fa-quote-right fa-sm"></i>
</blockquote>

<p>As this is a 4 credit course, students must spend a <strong>minimum</strong> of 8 hours of out-of-class work per week to earn a passing (D&ndash; or higher) letter grade. To earn a C or higher letter grade (as required for the CS major), students should expect to spend closer to <strong>10 to 20 hours per week</strong> on projects, homework, and participation assignments.</p>

<article class="message is-info">
  <div class="message-body">
    <i class="fas fa-briefcase"></i>&nbsp;Think of this class like a part-time job. If you do not put in the time, you will not make it to the final project. Many students do not pass due to poor time management!
  </div>
</article>

{% include section.html level="h3" name="Cheating Policy" %}

<p>All students are expected to know and adhere to the University's Honor Code (<a href="#{{ "Academic Integrity" | slugify }}">see below</a>). In short, students must never represent another person's work as their own. Examples of honor code violations include (but are not limited to):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Copying and pasting code (especially without attribution) from the web
  <li>Copying from another student (past or current)
  <li>Having anyone other than yourself complete your work (including tutors)
  <li>Working too closely with others such that your code no longer represents an individual contribution
  <li>Sharing your solutions with others (either directly or indirectly)
</ul>

<p><strong class="has-text-danger">Flagrant or repeat violations of the honor code will result in an F in the course, <a href="https://myusf.usfca.edu/academic-integrity/review-process">a report to the Academic Integrity Committee (AIC)</a>, and a report to the Dean.</strong> At the discretion of the instructor, a less severe penalty may be imposed for minor or first offenses. This is at the sole discretion of the instructor and any violation may result in an F in the course.</p>

<p>There are other less tangible consequences as well. Most CS professors do not write letters of recommendation for students caught cheating (making it more challenging to get into graduate school or be competitive on the job market). Even if you are not caught cheating, it is unlikely you will do well in future exams, one-on-one code reviews, or technical interviews.</p>

<article class="message is-danger">
  <div class="message-body">
    <i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i>&nbsp;Unauthorized collaboration or discussion that results in the same or very similar code indicates that you have not placed enough independent work into your submission and is a violation of the honor code.
  </div>
</article>

{% include section.html level="h3" name="Policy Exceptions" %}

<p>Exceptions to most course policies are made only in the case of verifiable exceptional circumstances. This includes medical emergencies, mental health and well-being crises, or family-related emergencies. Extensions must be arranged prior to the original deadline unless in case of extreme emergency (such as an emergency room visit).</p>

<article class="message is-info">
  <div class="message-body">
    <i class="fas fa-plane-departure"></i>&nbsp;Have travel plans for a family event (such as a wedding or graduation) or academic/professional conference (such as Grace Hopper or an internship interview)? Contact the instructor ahead of time to make arrangements. Keep in mind you will likely be asked to submit assignments early versus getting an extension. Please note exceptions will not be made for other events (such as concerts, comic cons, and so on).
  </div>
</article>

{% include section.html level="h3" name="Getting Help" %}

<p>A good rule of thumb is to seek help after you have been stuck for an hour. There are many ways to get help with this class:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>Ask questions on <a href="{{ site.data.course.piazza }}">Piazza</a>. Most questions receive a response in under 24 hours (sometimes within 30 minutes). You may figure out your problem before you get a response, but then you can delete your question or mark it as solved.</p></li>

  <li><p>Ask questions during the instructor office hours. Office hours are first-come first-serve and there is lots of seating (including power outlets for charging).</p></li>

  <li><p>Ask the teacher assistants for help during lab sessions or their office hours. All of the teacher assistants for this course took CS 212 previously with Professor Engle.</p></li>

  <li><p>Ask a CS tutor for help at the <a href="http://tutoringcenter.cs.usfca.edu/">CS Tutoring Center</a>. Many of the tutors took CS 212 previously (and many of them also took it with Professor Engle). However, even tutors that did not take CS 212 may be able to help. Sometimes, it just helps to talk about your code with someone (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">rubber duck debugging</a>).</p></li>

  <li><p>Ask your classmates for high-level help or hints, but be careful! To avoid violating the <a href="#{{ "Cheating Policy" | slugify }}">cheating policy</a> and <a href="#{{ "Academic Integrity" | slugify }}">academic integrity policy</a>, make sure you never share code with your classmates or look at the code of your classmates.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>If you are feeling generally overwhelmed (including emotionally) and need advice, do not hesitate to reach out to the instructor. Since office hours can be crowded at times, you are welcome to schedule an appointment with the instructor via <a href="{{ site.data.course.piazza }}">Piazza</a> to chat in private.</p>

<article class="message is-warning">

Students whose behavior is disruptive or who fail to comply with the instructor may be dismissed from the class for the remainder of the class period and may need to meet with the instructor or Dean prior to returning to the next class period. If necessary, referrals may also be made to the Student Conduct process for violations of the Student Conduct Code.</p>

{% include section.html level="h3" name="Academic Integrity" %}

<p>As a Jesuit institution committed to <em>cura personalis</em>&mdash;the care and education of the whole person&mdash;USF has an obligation to embody and foster the values of honesty and integrity. USF upholds the standards of honesty and integrity from all members of the academic community. All students are expected to know and adhere to the University's Honor Code. You can find the full text of the code online at <a href="http://myusf.usfca.edu/academic-integrity/">http://myusf.usfca.edu/academic-integrity/</a>. The policy covers:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>Plagiarism &ndash; intentionally or unintentionally representing the words or ideas of another person as your own; failure to properly cite references; manufacturing references.</p></li>

  <li><p>Working with another person when independent work is required.</p></li>

  <li><p>Submission of the same paper in more than one course without the specific permission of each instructor.</p></li>

  <li><p>Submitting a paper written by another person or obtained from the Internet.</p></li>
