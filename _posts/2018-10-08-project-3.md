For this project, you will extend your [previous project]({% post_url 2018-09-12-project-2 %}) to support multithreading. In addition to meeting the previous project requirements, your code must make a thread-safe inverted index, and use a work queue to build and search an inverted index using multiple threads.

{% include section.html level="h2" name="Functionality" %}

The core functionality of your project must satisfy the following requirements:

  - Maintain the functionality of the [previous project]({% post_url 2018-09-12-project-2 %}).

  - Process additional command-line parameters to **Pending**. See the [Input](#input) section for specifics.

  - Pending

  - **Pending.** See the [Output](#output) section for specifics.

The functionality of your project will be evaluated with the `Project3Test.java` group of JUnit tests.

It is important to develop the project iteratively. One possible breakdown of tasks are:

  - Get `log4j2` working and start adding debug messages in your code. Once you are certain a class is working, disable debug messages for that class in your `log4j2.xml` file.

- Consider extending your previous inverted index to create a thread-safe version. You may need to add additional functionality to your single-threaded versions.

- Create a thread-safe inverted index using the `synchronized` keyword. Do not worry about efficiency or using a custom lock class yet.

- Modify how you build your index (both from a directory and from the web) to use multithreading and a work queue. Make sure you still pass the unit tests.

- Modify how you search your index to use multithreading and a work queue. Make sure you still pass the unit tests.

- Once you are sure this version works, convert your inverted index to use a custom read/write lock class. Make sure you still pass the unit tests.

- ~~Start worrying about efficiency. Make sure you are not under or over synchronizing, and that your multithreaded code is faster on average than your single-threaded code.~~ **Do not worry about efficiency until after your first code review.**

- Test your code in a multitude of settings and with different numbers of threads. Some issues will only come up occasionally, or only on certain systems.

- Test your code with logging enabled, and then test your code with logging completely disabled. Your code will run faster without logging, which sometimes causes some concurrency problems.

- Lastly, do not start on this project until you understand the multithreading code shown in class. If you are stuck on the code shown in class, PLEASE SEEK HELP. You do not need to figure it out on your ownâ€”you can ask the CS tutors, the teacher assistant, or the instructor for help.

The important part will be to test your code as you go. The JUnit tests provided only test the entire project as a whole, not the individual parts. You are responsible for testing the individual parts themselves.
