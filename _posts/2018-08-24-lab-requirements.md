Lab sessions are new to CS 212 Software Development and serve multiple purposes:

  - Lab sessions set aside an hour of time free from other course conflicts that students can use to interact with a teacher assistant for help.

  - Lab sessions set aside an hour of time free from other course conflicts that students can use to attend one-on-one code reviews with the instructor.

  - Lab sessions set aside an hour of time outside of class that students can use to make progress on homework and projects.

  - Lab sessions provide a smaller cohort (15 students maximum) to interact with, which can be helpful for getting to know your classmates, getting help, and reviewing for exams.

The lab sessions in HR 411 will be run by the teacher assistants. The code reviews in HR 412B will be run by the instructor. Students should plan to attend either one lab session or one code review per week.

Any changes to the lab schedule (including cancelations) will be posted on [Google Calendar]({{ site.data.course.google }}) and announced on [Piazza]({{ site.data.course.piazza }}). Generally, there will not be lab sessions on the first or last week of class, on weeks with holidays, or during exam weeks.

### Attendance

You are *strongly encouraged* to attend every lab session in-person when possible. You must attend at least 5 lab sessions in-person to earn participation credit. To earn this participation credit, you must:

  1. Sign in with the teacher assistant when you arrive to your lab session.

  2. Enter the date you attended in the appropriate "Lab Attendance" assignment in Canvas.

You only need to do this until you earn 5 points of participation credit. You do not need to do this for the remaining times you attend lab sessions, or weeks you attend a code review instead of lab.

### Requirements

To earn lab credit, you must make at least 3 non-trivial commits (not including your first "trivial" commit to mark the start of lab) on homework or project over the course of an hour. This is essentially 1 commit per every 20 minutes. The commits can include adding comments to your code, working on functionality, and/or refactoring your code.

Ideally, this coding hour should occur during your assigned lab session. However, this is not a strict requirement (especially if you plan to attend a code review during lab instead). Your coding hour may occur _after_ your previous lab session and before the end of the current lab session.

For example, assume you are in the Tuesday lab and want to make your lab submission for week 3. Your coding hour can occur anytime after 11:35am on Tuesday 8/28 (your week 2 lab), but before 11:35am on Tuesday 09/04 (the end of your week 3 lab).
