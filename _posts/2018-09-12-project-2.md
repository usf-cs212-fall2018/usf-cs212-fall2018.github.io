title: Project 2 Partial Search

For this project, you will extend your [previous project]({% post_url 2018-08-27-project-1 %}) to support exact search and partial search. In addition to meeting the previous project requirements, your code must be able to parse and stem a query file, generate a sorted list of search results from the inverted index, and support writing those results to a JSON file.

Your main method must be placed in a class named `Driver`. The `Driver` class should accept the following **additional** command-line arguments:

  - `-query filepath` where `-query` indicates the next argument is a path to a text file of queries to be used for search. If this flag is not provided, then no search should be performed. In this case, your code should behave exactly the same as the previous project.

  - `-exact` where `-exact` is an *optional* flag that indicates all search operations performed should be **exact** search. If the flag is NOT present, any search operations should use **partial** search instead.

  - `-results filepath` where `-results` is an *optional* flag that indicates the next argument is the path to use for the search results output file. This may include partial or exact search results! If the `filepath` argument is not provided, use `results.json` as the default output filename. If the `-results` flag is not provided, do not produce an output file of search results but still perform the search operation.

  - `-locations filepath` where `-locations` is an *optional* flag that indicates the next argument is the path to use to output all of the locations and their word count. If the `filepath` argument is not provided, use `locations.json` as the default output filename. If the `-locations` flag is not provided, do not produce an output file of locations.

The command-line flag/value pairs may be provided in any order. Your code should support all of the command-line arguments from the [previous project]({% post_url 2018-08-27-project-1 %}) as well.

The locations and their word count should be output as a JSON object with the relative path of the file as the key and the word count (after cleaning, parsing, and stemming) as the value. Here is the expected output for the word count of all the text files associated with this project:

```javascript
{
	"text/gutenberg/1400-0.txt": 187368,
	"text/gutenberg/pg1228.txt": 157344,
	"text/gutenberg/pg1322.txt": 124370,
	"text/gutenberg/pg1661.txt": 107396,
	"text/gutenberg/pg37134.txt": 16696,
	"text/rfcs/rfc475.txt": 3228,
	"text/rfcs/rfc5646.txt": 27075,
	"text/rfcs/rfc6797.txt": 12925,
	"text/rfcs/rfc6805.txt": 9785,
	"text/rfcs/rfc6838.txt": 9367,
	"text/simple/.txt/hidden.txt": 1,
	"text/simple/a/b/c/d/subdir.txt": 1,
	"text/simple/animals.text": 11,
	"text/simple/animals_copy.text": 11,
	"text/simple/animals_double.text": 22,
	"text/simple/capital_extension.TXT": 1,
	"text/simple/capitals.txt": 4,
	"text/simple/digits.txt": 2,
	"text/simple/hello.txt": 6,
	"text/simple/position.teXt": 20,
	"text/simple/symbols.txt": 10,
	"text/simple/words.tExT": 24
}
```

You can also find this output in the [`project-tests/expected/index-text-locations.json`](https://github.com/usf-cs212-fall2018/project-tests/blob/master/expected/index-text-locations.json) file in the `project-tests` repository.
