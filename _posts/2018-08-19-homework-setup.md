Before you begin, you need to make sure to go through the following one-time setup guides first:

  - [Using CS Lab Computers]({% post_url 2018-08-18-using-cs-lab-computers %})

  - [Learning Git and Github]({% post_url 2018-08-19-learning-git-and-github %})

  - [Configuring SSH Keys]({% post_url 2018-08-20-configuring-ssh-keys %})

  - [Java and Eclipse Setup]({% post_url 2018-08-21-java-and-eclipse-setup %})

You only need to follow those guides once at the start of the semester.

For every homework assignment, you will need to repeat these steps:

  - **Setup your Github repository.** Click the Github Classroom invitation link to automatically setup a private Github repository with the template and test code in the `usf-cs212-fall2018` organization. Only you, the TAs, and the instructor will have access to this repository.

  - **Setup your Eclipse project.** Once your repository is setup, you must import the homework as a Java Project in Eclipse. See the [Importing Eclipse Projects from Github]({% post_url 2018-08-22-importing-eclipse-projects-from-github %}) guide for detailed steps.

  - **Verify you can push changes to Github.** In Eclipse, make a minor change and [commit and push](http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/User_Guide#Committing_Changes) that change to Github. I recommend placing the [Git Staging View](http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/User_Guide#Git_Staging_View) somewhere on your Eclipse layout to make this process more convenient.

  - **Verify you can run the `homework` script on the lab computers.** See the [Homework Testing]({% post_url 2018-08-20-homework-testing %}) guide for detailed steps.

At this point, you should be able to start filling in the missing code, committing changes, and pushing those changes to Github.
