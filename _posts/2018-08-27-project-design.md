We will use 20 minute one-on-one code reviews with the instructor to evaluate your project design. We will be looking for the following when reviewing your code:

  - Your code should follow proper code style and naming conventions.
  - Your code should be well-documented using Javadoc notation.
  - Your code should be object-oriented.
  - Your code should be encapsulated, generalized, and reusable.
  - Your code should be memory-efficient and time-efficient within reason.

This list is not exhaustive, and exactly what we look for will vary by project. To be eligible for code review, you must first pass the functionality for that project. You may only request code review for one project per week unless you have the explicit permission of the instructor. Projects will be reviewed one-at-a-time and sequentially (project 1 must pass both design and functionality before project 2 will be code reviewed, and so on).

    <i class="fas fa-hourglass-end"></i>&nbsp;Each code review is 20 minutes long. If we run out of time to review all of your code, you will have to follow the resubmission process before the remainder of your code will be reviewed. Please address small things before your code review so we can focus on more important matters. Make sure your code follows a style and naming convention, is well documented, and passes all tests locally and remotely.

{% include section.html level="h2" name="Code Review Appointments" %}

The TAs will provide instructions on how to sign up for code review after you follow the [Project Verification]({% post_url 2018-08-26-project-functionality %}#project-verification) steps successfully.

All appointment times are given in Pacific Time. You may need to double-check your Google Calendar time zone when signing up for appointments.

Please arrive on-time to your appointment. You can cancel your appointment in Google Calendar if necessary, but please do not make any changes 12 hours before your appointment time unless absolutely necessary (including adding new appointments or canceling appointments).

{% include section.html level="h2" name="Code Review Grading" %}

You will receive a 100% when you pass the code review (no matter how many resubmissions it takes). The results of each code review may be:

  - **Pass:** This means you passed code review and do not need to resubmit this project. You may now move on to the next project. Remember to incorporate all of the functionality and design of this project in your next project!

  - **Warn:** This means you passed code review and do not need to resubmit this project. You may move on to the next project, but there are some comments you must address in your next project submission to avoid deductions in your next review.

  - **Fail:** This means you did not passed code review and must resubmit this project. You must first address all of the review comments and re-verify you are passing the project functionality tests before resubmitting your project for code review.

It is highly likely you will fail code review at least once. Deductions are only made if you do not take this process seriously and waste the time of the instructor or teacher assistants. Specifically, the project grade will be adjusted as follows:

  - Receive –10% deduction if the projects are resubmitted without addressing the comments from before.

  - Receive –10% deduction if the projects are resubmitted without passing the functionality tests first.

  - Receive –10% deduction if are significantly late or completely miss a code review appointment more than once.

Otherwise, you may resubmit your project for code review as many times as it takes to perfect your code.
