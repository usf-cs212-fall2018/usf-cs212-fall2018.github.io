For this project, you will extend your [previous project]({% post_url 2018-10-08-project-3 %}) to create a fully functional search engine. This project is split into two main components: (1) a [multithreaded web crawler]({% post_url 2018-11-04-project-4a-web-crawler %}) using a work queue to build the index from a seed URL, and (2) a [search engine web interface]({% post_url 2018-11-04-project-4b-search-engine %}) using [embedded Jetty](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/) and servlets to search that index.

**This writeup is for the search engine functionality only.** See the general [Project 4 Writeup]({% post_url 2018-11-04-project-4 %}) for more details.

{% include section.html level="h2" name="Functionality" %}

The functionality for this project is broken into 2 parts: core functionality and extra features. You must complete the core functionality _before_ attempting extra features.

{% include section.html level="h3" name="Search Engine Core Functionality" %}

You must implement the following core features using embedded Jetty and servlets for a total of 20 points:

  - **Search (10 points):** Display a webpage with a text box where users may enter a multi-word search query, and a button that submits the query to your search engine.

  - **Results (10 points):** Your search engine should perform a partial search from an inverted index generated by your web crawler, and return an HTML page with sorted and clickable links to the search results.

You should not begin working on extra features until the core functionality is working properly.

{% include section.html level="h3" name="Search Engine Extra Functionality" %}

You must implement a minimum of 60 points worth of additional features. These features are broken into three categories: user tracking, database support, and extra functionality. You may choose any combination of features from these categories.

- Pending

You may implement more extra features than necessary to receive extra credit on this project. You may earn up to 20 extra credit points for implementing extra additional features.

{% include section.html level="h2" name="Input" %}

Your main method must be placed in a class named `Driver`. The `Driver` class should accept the following **additional** command-line arguments:

  - `-port num` where `-port` indicates the next argument is the port the web server should use to accept socket connections. Use `8080` as the default value if it is not provided.

      If the `-port` flag is provided, your code should **enable multithreading** with the default number of worker threads even if the `-threads` flag is not provided.

The command-line flag/value pairs may be provided in any order, and the order provided is not the same as the order you should perform the operations (i.e. always build the index before performing search, even if the flags are provided in the other order).

Your code should support all of the command-line arguments from the [previous project]({% post_url 2018-11-04-project-4a-web-crawler %}) as well.

{% include section.html level="h2" name="Output" %}

The majority of the output for this project will be in the form of HTTP responses to a browser. Only output the inverted index or search results to a file if the necessary flags are provided.

{% include section.html level="h2" name="Testing" %}

No tests will be provided for this project. Instead, you will demonstrate your search engine functionality to the instructor during your final code review appointment during finals week.
