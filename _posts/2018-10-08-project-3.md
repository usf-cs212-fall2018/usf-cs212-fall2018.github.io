For this project, you will extend your [previous project]({% post_url 2018-09-12-project-2 %}) to support multithreading. In addition to meeting the previous project requirements, your code must make a thread-safe inverted index, and use a work queue to build and search an inverted index using multiple threads.

{% include section.html level="h2" name="Functionality" %}

The core functionality of your project must satisfy the following requirements:

  - Maintain the functionality of the [previous project]({% post_url 2018-09-12-project-2 %}).

  - Process additional command-line parameters to **Pending**. See the [Input](#input) section for specifics.

  - Pending

  - **Pending.** See the [Output](#output) section for specifics.

The functionality of your project will be evaluated with the `Project3Test.java` group of JUnit tests.

It is important to develop the project iteratively. One possible breakdown of tasks are:

The important part will be to test your code as you go. The JUnit tests provided only test the entire project as a whole, not the individual parts. You are responsible for testing the individual parts themselves.
