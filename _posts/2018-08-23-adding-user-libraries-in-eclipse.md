title: Adding User Libraries in Eclipse

There is a step-by-step walkthrough on how to add user libraries in Eclipse at:

<http://tutoringcenter.cs.usfca.edu/resources/adding-user-libraries-in-eclipse.html>

It is important that you name your user libraries the same as the instructor. Otherwise, you may run into issues when importing Eclipse Java Projects from Github. Below are the names and links to the user libraries we will be using in this semester:

| Library | Eclipse Name | Download | Notes |
|---------|--------------|----------|-------|
| [Apache OpenNLP](http://opennlp.apache.org/) | `opennlp-tools` | [Link](http://opennlp.apache.org/download.html) | You need to add the `opennlp-tools-1.9.0.jar` in Eclipse. You do not need the other JAR files. |

This list will be updated over time.
